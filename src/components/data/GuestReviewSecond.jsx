        description: `Everything about my stay at Dino's was incredible, but what is truly amazing is how warm and welcoming he and his Mother and Sister are, they truly made me feel like I was at home. \nI planned to come for a few nights and ended up staying a few weeks this is how good I feel here. I work remotely and the internet worked really well for my online call needs, in between I would just jump in the river to cool down from the unforgiving summer heat or just catch a boat ride with Dino. \nIt is convenient that the train stops at the very property so you can travel easily from and to Sarajevo or Mostar and it is really a beautiful train ride! Generally, Dino was always willing to help with whatever I needed and show me around town.\nThe cherry on top of the cake? Dino's Mom Sabina cooks THE BEST meals! Being breakfast lunch or dinner, it was just delicious. I am really thankful I got to spend these two weeks here and I most definitely will be back! P.S.: Dino is best known as Dinosaurio!\n`,

        description: `Absolutely stunning location and views. But even better: Dino and his mother. The most incredible hospitality started with breakfast every morning, a boat ride around the lake, and a ride into the next town if we needed it. \nDino is the nicest host I have met in my travels. Our group had an incredible time thanks to him, and would absolutely recommend staying here. Also: cute kittens!\n`,
